# peaksCNN
This Matlab code follows the idea from the paper (in citaion) with some modifications, for training and using deep learning CNN (convolutional neural network) model to classify LC-MS features as true (high quality) and false (low quality).

## Use pretrained model for peak classification (use function "peaksEVA.m" or a GUI app "peakfilter.mlapp")
Example usage: download and unzip the code, type the following one-line code in matlab

    [ispeak, img]=peaksEVA('example_pos.mzXML', 'example_peaks_pos.csv', [5,6], 'net64');

Required inputs:
1) input .mzXML file
2) input peaklist file generated from peakpicking (XCMS,mzMINE,ElMaven)
3) specify column numbers for m/z and rt in the peaklist file.
4) name of the pretrained model. Two pretrained models are included in this repo: "net64.mat" and "net48.mat". They have similar performance except for the image compression ratio (to 64X64  vs. to 48X48). They were trained using the script "peaksCNN.m".

Output:
 1) A subfolder with a time stamp will be generated (i.e., tmp-2022-04-28-12:00), containing a "true" folder and a "false" folder. 
 2) images for EICs of all the peaks will be classified and saved into either "true" or "false" folders.  the output "img" stores an array of EIC images.
 3) A copy of the peaklist file will be created under the same folder, a new column "ispeak" (0 or 1) will be added to the peaklist.

Note: DO NOT close the popup figure (for updating EIC plots) until the run is completed.

## Train your own model. (use script "peaksCNN.m" )
1) download the training set from link below
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01309/suppl_file/ac1c01309_si_001.zip
2) Customize your model settings (optional, see below) and run peaksCNN.m.
<br /> a) Adjust the training data: manually examine the plots in true and false folders, make some rearrangement based on your judgement. You can also add some new images to the training data set, which could be obtained from the classification results of your own data.
<br /> b) change the architecture of the CNN models by adding/modifying/removing layers. (https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/layers-of-a-convolutional-neural-network.html) 
<br /> c) change the splits of training & validation sets
<br /> d) change the training options
3) After the run is completed, save the CNNmodel 'net' from workspace or type the code below. 
    
    save('mymodel.mat', 'net')
