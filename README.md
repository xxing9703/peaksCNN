# peaksCNN
This Matlab code follows the idea from the paper (in citaion) with some modifications, for training and using deep learning CNN (convolutional neural network) model to classify LC-MS features as true (high quality) and false (low quality).

## Use pretrained model for peak classification (use function peaksEVA.m)
Example usage: type the following one-line code in matlab

    peaksEVA('example_pos.mzXML','example_peaks_pos.csv',[5,6],'net64')

Required inputs:
1) input .mzXML file
2) input peaklist file generated from peakpicking (XCMS,mzMINE,ElMaven)
3) specify column numbers for m/z and rt in the peaklist file.
4) name of the pretrained model
Two pretrained models included in this repo:  "net64.mat" and "net48.mat". (difference: image compression to 64X64 or 48X48)

Output:
A subfolder with a time stamp will be generated, containing a "true" and a "false" folder. EICs of all the peaks will be plotted and classified into these two subfolders
a copy of the peaklist file will be created under the same folder, a new column "ispeak" will be added to the peaklist. 


## train your own model. (use script peaksCNN )
1) download the training set from link below
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01309/suppl_file/ac1c01309_si_001.zip
2) Do some modifications as instructed and run peaksCNN.m
